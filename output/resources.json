Weekly, youth will participate in a studio session to learn about the fabrication or repurposing process and materials required to create the outlined fashion. Then they will have time to design and fabric their own fashion to be modeled in the fashion show. We will utilize wearable technology, tulle, and fabric dye as well as learn how to hand sew and repurpose materials. The youth will be students of the fashion industry, learning about different career options as well as common terms and tools of the industry. Our goal is to use Homewood and adjacent neighborhoods as a campus for youth to expose youth to out-of-school environments that support their creative interest. To do weekly studio sessions will be hosted various locations and fashion show will be at Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh - Homewood Auditorium. This year our theme \"Reclaim & Remix\" to support we have collaborated with Pittsburgh Center for Creative Reuse to promote resource conservation and creativity through material reuse. Studio sessions will: June 27, July 11, 18, 25, August 1, 8, 15 and 22 ",

Initial pilots with groups of girls, followed by an expanded focus that included both boys and girls as well as teachers and in-school curricula led to a renaming of the project to Arts and Bots and a focus on creating curricula and technologies that integrate arts and crafts with engineering education. The Hummingbird as well as the CREATE Lab's Visual Programmer (the environment used by students to program Hummingbird) have co-evolved with the Arts and Bots program, and will continue to do so. As the core technologies of the Arts and Bots program became more stable and usable, parents, teachers, and administrators began asking if they could purchase additional Hummingbirds or steer their colleagues or friends to a vendor. We're happy to be releasing Hummingbird commercially under license from Carnegie Mellon, making this fantastic robotics kit widely available and allowing the Arts and Bots research program to grow and scale without the constraint of being responsible for manufacturing and distributing a commercial product.",

They will be faced with a series of challenges everyday that will include programming Lego Mindstorms robots using basic moves and advanced routines with different types of sensors (touch, ultrasonic, and light). At the end of each day the students will apply the concepts learned to play fun and strategic games. This year, students will design and program robots to solve a real world challenge: Surviving in Mars. We will cover topics in computer science, technology, engineering, math, and science in a fun and exciting environment. ",

            "resource_description": "Beginners' fiction often fails because the plot is too ordinary or simply disorganized. In this intensive four-day summer workshop designed especially for teens, you'll learn how to craft a logical storyline; structure scenes for maximum creative impact; and devise realistic conflicts with satisfying resolutions. Once you have the basic outline, then you'll learn how to make your characters and plot come alive with powerful, descriptive writing, figurative language, and original and accurate details. In-class exercises and brief out-of-class excursions will focus on three key areas: How to make characters memorable; how to create distinct settings; and how to describe awesome action sequences. Over the course of this three-day summer camp, teenagers develop a complete fiction story, and workshop it just as the pros do. Forget flat, one-dimensional fiction and give your readers a story that will stick with them long after they read the last page!",
